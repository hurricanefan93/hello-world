    <p class="the-web">The web seems to be constantly changing. It seems as though the web is taking over in many avenues. Technology is becoming very available, and there are constant changes and improvements. With those improvements, developers have more power and freedom to create. I think the world wide web is an amazing tool and resource and will keep progressing everyday! </p>
